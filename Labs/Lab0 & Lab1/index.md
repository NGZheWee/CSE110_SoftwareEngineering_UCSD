## 1. Basic Background & Early Life
My preferred name is **Derrick**, and my legal name is Zhe Wee NG (with 'Zhe Wee' being my first name and 'NG' as my last name).  
My pronouns are "He", but definitely not "Him", because I know I'll never be "Him".  
I am a Malaysian Chinese, but I lived in various parts of China for most of my life.  

Just in case you're interested in what I look like:

## 4. Programming Language Proficiencies  
Below is a list of the programming language I am interested. I've marked the ones I'm more familair with and for each of them I wrote a code snippet to demonstrate so：

- [x] ([C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)))
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   // printf() displays the string inside quotation
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```
- [x] ([Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java)）
```
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}
```
- [x] ([C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B))
```
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```
