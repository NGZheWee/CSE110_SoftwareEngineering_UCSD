# CSE110_Lab0-1  

For Part2 of the assignment, I created 2 branches:
1.  The "add-read-me" branch is for Command Line part
2.  The "add-gitignore" branch is for the VSCode UI part(this is where the .gitignore cold be found).

To avoid confusions, the main brach is hence where I used to create my User Page for Part3 of the assignment, including the files I created for creating the User Page.  
The screenshots folder and the README file (the one you are reading now obviously) with the URL to my publish Github sites could also be found in the main branch.
