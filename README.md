# CSE110: Software Engineering (Fall 2022, UCSD)

This repository contains coursework from **CSE110: Software Engineering**, which I took in Fall 2022 at UC San Diego. The course focused on software engineering principles, team-based development, and project management using Agile methodology. Key topics include software development best practices, version control, and collaborative development.

## Contents:

- **Labs**: Contains lab assignments focused on individual software development tasks, emphasizing best practices in coding, testing, and debugging.
- **Group Project**: Includes the group project where we applied Agile development techniques to collaboratively build a software application, including sprint planning, code reviews, and final project deliverables.

## Key Concepts Covered:

- **Agile Methodology**: Sprint-based development cycles, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives for continuous improvement.
- **Version Control**: Using Git and GitHub for managing code versions, branching strategies, and collaborative development.
- **Code Reviews**: Conducting and participating in code reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices.
- **Testing and Debugging**: Writing unit tests, integration tests, and using automated testing frameworks to ensure code correctness.
- **Software Design**: Principles of modular design, code refactoring, and applying design patterns in software development.
- **Collaboration**: Teamwork, task delegation, and using tools like GitHub Projects and Trello for tracking tasks and progress.

## How to Navigate:

- **Labs**: You can find all lab assignments under the `Labs/` directory, with each lab containing code and relevant documentation on software engineering practices.
- **Group Project**: The `Group Project/` directory contains the group project, detailing our software engineering process, team roles, and contributions toward building the final project.

## Conclusion:

Explore the coursework to see implementations of software engineering principles, including version control, Agile methodology, and collaborative project development techniques.
